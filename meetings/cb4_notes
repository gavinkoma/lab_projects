stain for chat

only take high mag of places of interest

do a 5x first and then zoom into the areas of interest

monosynaptic boutons are vGLUT1

we also dont really need to see the DREADDs labeling because vGLUT1 are 1a neurons 

action points:
1. x animals one with mcherry
	this could still do the triple stain of more connections
2. 

how many animals have motor nuerons that can be zoomed in on w/ vglut1 boutons can be counted. 

can we get more by doing chat to label motor neurons

how many have all three 

theoretically we could just take the total count on a computer screen like nih imagej and look at green boutons that connect to the motor pools 

2 sources, 1a's and corticospinal but no corticospinal because of lesion. so only vglut synapses 

count puncta of vglut1 between controls and experimentals confirm this though with actual imaging of the motor neurons. cannot make determine if making connections with apical dendrites or cell bodies uhoh 

normalize puncta to area --> motor pools will change per size so do a circle/elipsis ROI; we have confocal images of motor neurons with chat and colabeling them with vglut2 for proprioceptive but we will do vGLUT1

confocal 20x

ask ajay for extra tissue if needed at all in control cords --> normal extra control tissue and we have a ton 

DRGs --> will be down the road
